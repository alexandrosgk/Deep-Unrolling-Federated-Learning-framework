# Deep-Unrolling-model-for-Lidar-Super-Resolution
Considering the high cost of high-resolution Lidar sensors, in this work, a novel Lidar super-resolution method is proposed to improve the performance on numerous autonomous vehicle perception tasks, including that of a Lidar odometer. In more detail, we propose a regularized optimization problem  employing a learnable regularizer (neural network) to capture the properties of the data. To efficiently solve this problem, a deep unrolling methodology is proposed, thus forming  an interpretable and well-justified deep architecture, where  its learnable parameters derived from the solution of
the optimization algorithm.
